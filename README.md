# DSUL - Disturb State USB Light

The goal of the project is to have a USB connected light, that can be be set to different colors, with adjustable brightness and different modes, which can communicate the users current preference regarding being disturbed.

## Hardware

The hardware used is an Arduino connected to a Neopixel module. The project was developed using an Arduino Nano, but should work on most models as long as the firmware fit and it has enough RAM for the number of LED's used in the module.

## Software

The software, daemon/server and client is available at [hymnis/dsul-python](https://github.com/hymnis/dsul-python).
